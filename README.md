# malaria-cell-infection-detection

Detection of Malaria Infected cell images using different machine learning techniques

## Main Prerequisites

* Keras
* Tensorflow
* Light GBM
* XGBoost

## Usage
* Creating a dataset:
    ```python dataset_creator -l 10000```
    ** -l - size of the dataset to be created
* Training a model
    ```python model.py -m lgbm```
    ** -m - type of training method to be used
       *** lgbm - Light Gradient Boosting
       *** xgbm - Xtreme Gradient Boosting
       *** cnn - Convolutional Neural Network
* Evaluation of models
  ```python prediction.py -l 100```
  ** -l - number of samples to be evaluated.

## Feature Engineering
  For the features used. I used a biult in algorithm on opencv called KAZE algorithm. This algorithm is used to extract features of images and compare it with the features of other images. Every images is composed of 2047 numerical features generated by KAZE algorithm. 

## Main Observations and Hypothesis
  Based on observation and multiple testings Gradient boosting methods are mostly effective on datasets with very large features. However the CNN method performed badly. During the training phase XGBoost Model and Light GBM model can fastly segregate the prediction values from nearly 0 and 1 upon increasing the number of boost rounds.
